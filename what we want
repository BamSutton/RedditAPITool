what we want

all of the subreddits associated to the search terms - public only
    this will have 
    - Name of subreddit
    - Description
    - number of subscribers
    - when it was created


all of the submissions from the those subreddits that use the search term we are looking for
    this will have
    - Post title
    - post content
    - author of the post
    - List of comments related to that post
    - Time created
    - number of upvotes

    * should this be submission centric? - have the subreddit information inside of this object and make it the bases of the app?
        would make origizing data based on subreddit a pain



all of the comments from all of those submissions
    this will have
    - comment content
    - author of comment
    - upvotes
    - created

Thoughts around using data frames for the this information? - might be a shit idea though

Things i think i need to know 
    - How does the tool Pat is using expect to see the data
    - Do i need to create two different files for this (human readable and application readable)


Functions needed?
    needs to be able to select a random percentage of the total submissions
        ? is this to be equal across all subreddits run against - or random across all at the same time
    
    needs to be able to print these out into a csv
        probably both human readable and app readable
